# Vehicle Detection and Counting System on Streamlit

![Demo image](Resources/demo.jpg)

## Introduction
This project is used to count and detect vehicle on the highway. It can detect 4 types of vehicles: car, motorcycle, bus, truck.
I run this project on Python 3.9.7

#
* [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/releases) to detect objects on each of the video frames.

* [Deep SORT](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) to track those objects over different frames and help counting.

* [Streamlit](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) to build a simple web.
## Installation

* Install essential libraries and packages:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Run demo:
```python
streamlit run demo.py --server.maxUploadSize=500
```

**NOTE**: If the web keeps showing "Please wait...", try to install streamlit version 1.11.0
```python
pip install streamlit==1.11.0
```

If the web shows error "no module easydict"
```python
pip install easydict
```

# DEMO

![Settings](Resources/setting.jpg)
* Confidence: the probability that one object belongs to one class

* Line position: the position of green line, any vehicle have coordinate below the line will be counted

3. Click ```START```
